DESCRIPTION
  All preprocessors is started with "==PREPROCESSOR==" and ended with "==/PREPROCESSOR==":
    VBSCRIPT:
      ' // ==PREPROCESSOR==
      ' ...
      ' // ==/PREPROCESSOR==

    JScript:
      // ==PREPROCESSOR==
      // ...
      // ==/PREPROCESSOR==

  And be aware that all preprocessors (directives) are case sensitive.

DIRECTIVES
  Directives should be started with "@", and placed into a single comment.
  e.g:
    VBScript:
      ' // ==PREPROCESSOR==
      ' // @directive "value-here"
      ' // ==/PREPROCESSOR==

    JScript:
      // ==PREPROCESSOR==
      // @directive "value-here"
      // ==/PREPROCESSOR==

  @import "path"
  Load external script from "path".
  Remarks:
    You can place %fb2k_path%, %fb2k_component_path% and %fb2k_profile_path% into "path", they will be expanded while parsing.
    Escape one double quote (") with two double quotes ("") if path includes double quote(") character. eg: @import "D:\""Something"""

  @feature "feature-string"
  Set feature(s).

      "v1.4" - Effects:
               Change on_metadb_changed() callback behavior, see Callbacks.txt for more information.
               Disable window.WatchMetadb() and window.UnWatchMetadb() methods permanently ("watch-metadb" won't help);
               No parameter will be passed to on_selection_changed() callback.

    -commons:
      "watch-metadb" - Set by default when version is only "v1.0".
