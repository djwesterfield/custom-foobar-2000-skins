Razzlie's Minimalism ver. 1.1

Note: Fresh install of foobar2000 is recommended to avoid known issues with broken component errors

Installation instructions assume you are using a fresh install of foobar2000

Installation: 

1)Extract the foobar2000 folder over the installation directory of f2k, overwrite if asked to

2)Manually install the components files inside the folder by double clicking them so you have all of them available for use, these ones have a foobar icon on them and aren't the usual .dll files

3)Open the Windows Explorer and enter %appdata%/foobar2000 into the directory field

4)Extract the contents of the %appdata% folder into it, overwrite if asked to

As this layout is intended to be highly functional while maintaining minimalism, keyboard shortcuts are intended to be used.

By default, they aren't enabled as global hotkeys to prevent potential problems with other software, so they only work with foobar2000 as the current selection, with Ctrl+Shift+Q as the sole exception.
