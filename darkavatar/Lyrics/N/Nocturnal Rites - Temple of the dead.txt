Title: Temple of the dead

A dynasty falls, another reborn
The Pharaoh's legacy, carved into stone
IN scriptures of Re, the God of the Nile
Tell how to bury the chosen

Open the temple
Entomb the soul of the king

As the gate opened up,
and we saw the temple inside
Heard the calling from beyond,
in the temple of the dead

The new king is born, gets the white crown
Reigning in slavery, cult of the damned
The people rebel, dethroning the King
Comes withour warning, a shadow

Break the seal
Awake the soul Re
A prophecy
Then the dead arise, the dead shall arise
