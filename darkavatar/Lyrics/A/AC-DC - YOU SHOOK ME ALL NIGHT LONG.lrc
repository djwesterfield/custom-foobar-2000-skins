[00:04.95]Title: YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG




















[00:30.60]She was a fast machine












[00:32.30]She kept her motor clean












[00:34.25]She was the best damn woman I had ever seen












[00:38.13]She had the sightless eyes












[00:40.13]Telling me no lies












[00:42.47]Knockin' me out with those American thighs












[00:45.91]Taking more than her share












[00:47.61]Had me fighting for air












[00:49.94]She told me to come but I was already there
















[00:53.48]'Cause the walls start shaking












[00:55.50][01:41.18]The earth was quaking












[00:57.14][01:42.42]My mind was aching












[00:59.23][01:44.58]And we were making it and you -






























[01:02.13][01:47.76][02:03.14][02:10.12][02:50.82][02:58.14][03:05.57]Shook me all night long












[01:08.10][01:53.45]Yeah you shook me all night long
















[01:15.92]Working double time












[01:17.66]On the seduction line












[01:19.63]She was one of a kind, she's just mine all mine












[01:23.26]She wanted no applause












[01:25.46]Just another course












[01:27.15]Made a meal out of me and came back for more












[01:30.94]Had to cool me down












[01:32.89]To take another round












[01:34.73]Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing
















[01:38.86]'Cause the walls were shaking
















































































[01:59.85]And knocked me out and then you
























[02:07.98]You had me shakin' and you
























[02:14.92]Yeah you shook me












[02:18.70]Well you took me










[02:20.20]
