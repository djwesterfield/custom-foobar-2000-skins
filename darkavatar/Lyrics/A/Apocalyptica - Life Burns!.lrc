[00:10.65]We break our enemies with fear and












[00:14.73]We've seen how the tears come around












[00:18.94]We build our confidence on wasteland












[00:24.69]We've seen how the walls come down
















[00:29.04][00:56.47][02:54.70][02:57.35][03:00.12][03:00.20]Life burns
















[00:35.43][01:23.37][01:46.17][02:13.22][02:31.80]A man dies like a butterfly












[00:39.60][01:29.15][01:55.75][02:15.41][02:37.86]Life burns from the touch of the Reaper












[00:42.90][01:32.03][02:18.45][02:40.64]All things must pass












[00:46.42][01:35.64][02:22.45][02:44.93]One love is crooked lie












[00:49.76][01:39.03][02:25.47][02:48.04]The world lies in the hands of evil












[00:52.69][01:42.11][02:28.46][02:51.41]We pray it would last
































[01:02.44]We have no sympathy for the lost souls












[01:08.96]We've chosen the path of disgrace












[01:13.25]We give this life to our children












[01:18.83]And teach them to hate this place




















































































































[01:58.57]One love is a crooked lie
















[02:00.88][02:03.57][02:06.01][02:08.29][02:10.71]The world lies in the hands of the evil
