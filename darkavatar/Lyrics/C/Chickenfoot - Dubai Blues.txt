Album: Chickenfoot III
I got on champagne on the table
In a hand-blown crystal glass
Antique china, sterling silver
Got the pheasant on my glass
I got my 747 with my own bedroom
But I ain't got you
No, I ain't got you, hey, baby

I got more change in my pocket
Than your boyfriend will ever make
A gold palace on the water
Filled with butlers and maids
I got more money in your country like your spendin' times two
But I ain't got you
No, I can't find you

I said, oh baby, all I want
But I ain't got you
I said, oh baby, all I got
Is the Dubai blues, I got the Dubai blues, yeah

I got a 100 acre theme park
Right there in my backyard
365 Bentleys
One day for every car

I got big love, if you want it
If you want it, just come and get it
If you said, I'll make you happy
Snap your fingers, I'll be there
I'll have yopu dripping in diamonds from your head to your shoes
But I ain't got you
No, I can't find you

I said, oh baby, all I want
But I ain't got you, oh no
I said, oh baby, all I got
Is the Dubai blues, I got the Dubai blues, yeah

Oh baby, all I want
I ain't got you, no, I ain't got you
I said, oh baby, all I got
Is the Dubai blues, I got the Dubai blues, yeah

Got everything, oh baby
I ain't got you
I ain't got nothin', baby
I ain't got nothin', baby

'Cause I ain't got you, ain't got you
'Cause I ain't got you, ain't got you
Ain't got you
Dubai blues
Ain't got you
No I ain't got you, ain't got you
Hey, Dubai blues
