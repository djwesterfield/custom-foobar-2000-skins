[01:12.07]Look out at the darkness, and you will see.




[01:22.60]Just call my name and I'll be there.




[01:33.18]You cannot touch me, you would not dare.




[01:43.42]I am the chill that's in the air.








[02:05.32][03:18.84][05:52.66]And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,




[02:15.91][03:29.75][06:03.72]As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.








[02:34.98]Dark rivers are flowing back into the past.




[02:45.46]You are the fish for which I cast.




[02:55.92]And what of the future, what is to be.




[03:06.65]As the rivers flow into the sea.




















[05:08.26]Do not take for granted, powers out there.




[05:19.03]Don't step into the demon's lair.




[05:29.89]Time is an illusion, rising from time.




[05:40.71]Steep is the mountain which we climb.
