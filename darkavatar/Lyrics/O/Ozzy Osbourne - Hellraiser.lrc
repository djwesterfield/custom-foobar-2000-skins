[00:46.81]I'm living on an endless road
[00:48.92]Around the world for rock and roll
[00:51.43]Sometimes it feels so tough
[00:53.67]But I still ain't had enough
[00:56.32]I keep saying that it's getting too much
[01:01.07]But I know I'm a liar
[01:06.17]Feeling all right in the noise and the light
[01:10.98]But that's what lights my fire
[01:15.94]Hellraiser, in the Thunder and heat
[01:20.44]Hellraiser, rock you back in your seat
[01:25.56]Hellraiser, and I'll make it come true
[01:30.25]Hellraiser, I'll put a spell on you
[01:36.60]
[01:46.61]Walking out on another stage
[01:48.70]Another town, another place
[01:51.09]Sometimes I don't feel right
[01:53.25]Nerves wound up too damn tight
[01:55.83]People keep telling me it's bad for my health
[02:00.70]But kicking back don't make it
[02:05.99]Out of control, I play the ultimate role
[02:10.50]But that's what lights my fire
[02:15.11]
[02:15.45]Hellraiser, in the Thunder and heat
[02:20.12]Hellraiser, rock you back in your seat
[02:25.20]Hellraiser, and I'll make it come true
[02:29.70]Hellraiser, I'll put a spell on you
