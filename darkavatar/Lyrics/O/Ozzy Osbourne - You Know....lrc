[ti:You Know...]

[00:18.67]Tried to be your father
[00:20.86]Things just made it harder
[00:24.29]Sorry if I made you cry
[00:31.29]Years turned you against me
[00:34.11]Heart was always aching
[00:37.29]And I never thought you'd say goodbye
[00:42.79]I could have been wrong
[00:46.86][00:53.36]You know...
[00:49.29]I should have been strong

[01:00.73](That'll do...Ha ha ha!)
