Artist: Ozzy Osbourne
Title: Get Me Through

I'm not the kind of person you think I am
I'm not the Anti-Christ or the iron man

I have a vision that I just can't control
I feel I've lost my spirit and sold my soul

Got no control

I tried to entertain you the best I can
I wish I started walking before I ran
But I still I love the feeling I get from you
I hope you'll never stop cause

It gets me through...yeah
It gets me through...yeah

The feelings that I hide behind
Sometimes reality's unkind
The nightmare starts for me at night
I dread the long and lonely nights

I'm not the kind of person you think I am
I'm not the Anti-Christ or the iron man
But I still I love the feeling I get from you
I hope you'll never stop cause
It gets me through...yeah
I'm just tryin' to live...yeah (Repeat)
