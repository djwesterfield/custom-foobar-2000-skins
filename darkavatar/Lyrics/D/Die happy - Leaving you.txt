Artist: Die happy
Title: Leaving you

Why was I so blind - I
didn't see the obvious
why was I happy when I was in pieces
why was I stupid - how did
I even fall for you
why was I crying, when we finally broke up
why was I with you when you didn't want to
change your mind
why was I with you when you
forced me to resign

It's over now

LEAVING YOU IS ALL THAT YOU CAN
BLAME ME FOR
LEAVING YOU
IF YOU LIKE IT OR NOT
KIND OF STRANGE BITTER TASTE
IT'S GONE TOO FAR
IF YOU LIKE IT OR NOT

Why was I so blind - my eyes were filled
with my good will
why was I laughing when you were speechless
why was I with you when you didn't want to
change your life
why was I with you when you forced me to
decide

It's over now

You were never sure
talking 'bout the freedom that you'd lose
well I lost a little more
trying to solve this
problem, find an excuse
well, I appreciate it
but I've decided now

All that you can blame me for is that
I stayed too long
everything you take me for
is definitely wrong
you won't get another chance to prove
your faith in me
all that you can blame me
for is that I disagree
