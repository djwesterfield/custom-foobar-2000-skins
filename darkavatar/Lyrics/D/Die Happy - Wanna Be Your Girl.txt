Title: Wanna Be Your Girl

I can see your hungry eyes slide up and down
And all around me
 Go for the maximum, I gotta say you're a blast,
 So come and show me

I kind of knew what to do, wearing what I wear,
 My little black Ah...
Your hot lips on my ear whisper:
 "Meet me on the 21st floor!"

[Bridge]
When you undress me
 I'm wearing just your tie

[Refrain 2x]
I really wanna be your girl
 I know exactly what you need
I really wanna be your girl
 Now or never never never

It feels like someone blew my mind on the elevator Ground,
 Baby - you know
You really are my shooting star and I am your guitar,
 playing solo
I am your prisoner now my fingers kind of ride
 down your back Ah...
Your hot lips on my ear whisper:
 "Welcome to the 21st floor!"

[Bridge]
When you undress me
 I'm wearing just your tie

[Refrain 2x]
I really wanna be your girl
 I know exactly what you need
I really wanna be your girl
 Now or never never never

I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna dance
 I don't wanna talk to all your friends
All I wanna do is play around with you

[Refrain]
I really wanna be your girl
I know exactly what you need
 Baby are you ready for me
Now or never never never


I really wanna be your girl
I really wanna be your girl
 I really wanna be your girl
Now or never never never
