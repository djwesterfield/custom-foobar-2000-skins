Title: Slow Day

There's a traffic jam outside my window
There's a red light on that just won't change
The pavement's full of cracks from all the sunshine
But now they're filling up 'cause the rain is falling down

I'm running round in circles
Trying to find my way

It's a slow day without you
It's a slow day when you're not around
It's a slow day with no escape
It's a slow day without you

There's a jet-plane up there hanging in the sky
Just kind of resting his wings on that big white cloud
Minutes taking on but stretching out forever
Just like the rooftops out there - they all melt together

I'm running 'round in circles
Trying to find my way

24 long hours with nothing to do
24 long hours just hanging on, waiting for you
It's gonna be a slow day
