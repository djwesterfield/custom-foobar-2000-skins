[00:06.58][02:19.34]You walk on like a woman in suffering




[00:25.69][02:48.65]Won't even bother now to tell me why




[00:28.48][02:51.49]You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment




[00:31.79][02:54.95]Leaving me broken another time




[00:34.22][02:57.28]You come on like a bloodstained hurricane




[00:36.81][02:59.90]Leave me alone, let me be this time




[00:39.68][03:02.71]You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption




[00:42.65][03:05.53]I don't want to mention, the reason I know






[00:46.61][01:41.54][03:09.45]That I am stricken and can't let you go




[00:52.53][01:47.12][03:15.17]When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know




[00:57.49][01:52.41][03:20.43]That I am crippled by all that you've done




[01:03.75][01:58.62][02:08.15][03:26.63][03:32.30]Into the abyss will I run






[01:15.39]You don't know what your power has done to me




[01:20.73]I want to know if I'll heal inside




[01:23.85]I can't go on with a holocaust about to happen




[01:27.08]Seeing you laughing another time




[01:29.13]You'll never know how your face has haunted me




[01:31.72]My very soul has to bleed this time




[01:34.54]Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses




[01:37.70]Leaving me breathless, the reason I know






















































































[03:36.38]I can't let you go




[03:41.67]Yes I am stricken and can't let you go
