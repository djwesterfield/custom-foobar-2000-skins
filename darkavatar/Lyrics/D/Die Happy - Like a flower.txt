Title: Like a flower

I.
this is my world
I am the queen
I'm doing what I want
can be really mean

I could grow strong
and have sharp thorns
go painfully through your skin
anytime I want

but when I'm small
you break my neck
I can't defend myself
close my eyes instead

Ref:
I AM A FLOWER
IN THE SUN ¨C IN BLOOM
I AM A FLOWER
I GROW FOR YOU

II.
I can make you burn
I can make you freeze
for every enemy
I have a special disease

but when I'm small
my life is in your hands
I can't defend myself
against your violence

III.
so here I am
look into my eyes
do not forget my name
I don't say it twice

I want your care
your total love
don't wait too long, my dear
I could get rough, take care

I want it now

Flower, flower, without your water I will die, won't you care for me
