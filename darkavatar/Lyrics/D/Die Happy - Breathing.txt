Title: Breathing

A day at my window
wrinkles on my face
'n you were so strong
and told me 'bout your faith
buried on Friday
was more than I could bear
snowflakes in my eyes
melting fast, much too fast

NOW YOU SEE
YOU FEEL ME WHEN I'M BREATHING
BUT YOU, YOU'RE NOT HERE
WHEN LIFE ISN'T EASY
WHEN I'M FALLING DOWN

A day at my window
wrinkles on my face
you were so strong
and told me 'bout your faith
buried on Wednesday
was more than I could bear
snowflakes in my eyes
melting fast, much too fast

NOW YOU SEE
YOU FEEL ME WHEN I'M BREATHING
BUT YOU, YOU'RE NOT HERE
WHEN LIFE ISN'T EASY
NOW YOU SEE
YOU FEEL ME WHEN I'M BREATHING
BUT YOU'RE GONE, CAN'T BE HERE
HERE WITH ME
YOU ARE GONE AND I'M TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND
