		<h1>Important changes</h1>
		
		This chapter describes important changes and news. Please have a look at the
		<a href="../Mp3tagVersion.txt">history of changes</a> for a complete list.
	</div>
	
	<div>
	    <a id="v246"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.46</h1>
	    
	    <h2>Explorer Shell Extension</h2>
	    The right-click menu extension is now realised by a dedicated Shell extension
	    which improves opening files and directories via the context menu also for large
	    amounts of files.
	    
	    <h2>Improved user-defined field mappings</h2>
        The user-defined mappings for field names introduced in Mp3tag v2.45 now have an 
        own <a href="main_mapping.html">help page</a> and were further improved with regard 
        to mapping multiple field names to one user-defined field name.
	    
	    <h2>Improved Tag Sources dialog</h2>
	    The Tag Sources dialog now also supports reordering of files via drag and drop
	    allowing to quickly rearrange files according to the titles. Yes, we made it work
	    with multiple files too :-)
	    The sorting and selection state of the Tag Sources search results are now also
	    remembered if you decide to go back and pick another result.
	    
	    <h2>Portable settings</h2>
        Previous versions of Mp3tag stored toolbar and panel positions in the Windows Registry.
        This changed with this release so that Mp3tag now stores all configuration data in its 
        own configuration files.
	</div>
	    
	<div>
	    <a id="v245"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.45</h1>
	    
	    <h2>Improved Filter</h2>
	    The filter now supports <a href="main_filter.html">filter expressions</a> where it is now
	    possible to combine filter criteria and use format strings for filtering. The filter now
	    also comes with a history, providing easy access to your often-used filter expressions.
	    
	    <h2>User-defined field mappings</h2>
	    Mp3tag now supports user-defined mappings for field names. This is particularly useful 
	    in case you need to make field names consistent across different types of tags 
	    (e.g., BAND in ID3v2 and ALBUM ARTIST in FLAC). The feature is available via
	    'Options &gt; Tags &gt; Mapping' where you can create mappings for a specific tag type 
	    (APEv2, ID3v2, MP4, VorbisComment or WMA), provide a Source name (Mp3tag's internal name) 
	    and a target name (your preferred field name).
	    
	    <h2>Multiline fields for Tag Panel</h2>
	    Are you adding lyrics, artist biographies or other text-intensive information to your songs?
	    If so, you can now add multiline custom fields to the Tag Panel via 
	    <a href="options_tagpanel.html">Options &gt; Tag Panel</a>.
	</div>
	
	<div>
	    <a id="v243"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.43</h1>
	    
	    <h2>Automatic Updates</h2>
	    This version comes with support for automatic checking for updates on program startup. You
	    can decide whether you want to get notified on stable final releases only, or whether you
	    want the freshest stuff from our compilers (Beta versions). If you don't want Mp3tag to check
	    for updates you can disable it completely at 'Options > Updates'.
	    
	    <h2>Horizontal Tag Panel</h2>
	    While it was always possible to drag the Tag Panel and dock it above or below
	    Mp3tag's file list, the input fields are now arranged more effectively. It's also
	    possible to disable the directory switcher from the Tag Panel.
	    
	    <h2>New Translations</h2>
	    Mp3tag is now also translated to Danish, Hebrew, Vietnamese, and Ukranian language.

	<div>
		<a id="v234"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.34 - Support for cover art / Import from Amazon.com</h1>
		
		<h2>Support for cover art</h2>
		With the new release Mp3tag supports embedded cover art for files with ID3v2 tags, TTA- and WMA files.
		You can add cover art via the <img src="images/mt_tag.png" alt="extended tag dialog" /> extended tag dialog at <span class="menu">View &gt; Extended Tags...</span>
		or <span class="hotkey">Alt</span> + <span class="hotkey">T</span>.
		
		<h2>Import from Amazon.com</h2>
		Besides the freedb support, Mp3tag now has the ability to get album information from Amazon.com. Just
		choose the small arrow from the right of the Icon <img src="images/mt_freedb.png" alt="freedb" /> and
		select <strong>Amazon.com</strong>. You'll get a list of matching items and can choose the
		album to import the tags (and cover art).<br />
		<br />
		The Amazon.com import uses Mp3tag's incredible web source framework. There are even more web sources
		available at the <a href="http://forums.mp3tag.de/index.php?showtopic=1794">Web Source Archive</a> on the
		Mp3tag forums.
		<p>
			<strong>Please visit the <a href="http://forums.mp3tag.de">Mp3tag forums</a> if you have other questions regarding the new release.</strong>

	<div>
		<a id="v233"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.33 - Support for Unicode</h1>
		Probably the most import change and new feature in this version is the support for Unicode through
		the whole program. Mp3tag writes ID3v2 tags in Unicode format (UTF-16) by default now, but there are
		still some programs, portables or car radios which have problems with ID3v2 tags stored in Unicode format
		(though this is specified within the ID3v2 standard). To use Mp3tag with this programs or devices, simply
		enable the option <strong>Always write ISO-8859-1 tags instead of UTF-16</strong> at
		<strong>Options &gt; Tags &gt; Mpeg</strong>. After that, just save the tags again by clicking 
		<img src="images/mt_save.png" alt="File &gt; Save tag" /> or by using the
		<span class="hotkey">Ctrl</span> + <span class="hotkey">S</span> hotkey.<br />
		<br />
		If you have problems displaying tags with characters from other charsets (like Cyrillic) in Mp3tag, the
		tags are probably stored in a system codepage instead of Unicode or ISO-8859-1. To convert these tags
		from a specific codepage to Unicode, simply create a new action <span style="color:green">Convert codepage</span>,
		select the appropriate tag field(s) and choose the codepage from the drop-down list.

	<div>
		<a id="v227"></a><h1>Mp3tag v2.27 - New syntax for scripting functions</h1>
		
		The last versions had major problems with the backslash and the double quotes characters
		within scripting functions so we had to reimplement the part which is responsible for
		evaluating the built in functions.<br />
		The names of the functions did not change - you don't have to learn new function names
		or placeholder names.		

		<h2>What has changed?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>There is no need to put parameters of function in double quotes anymore.</li>
			<li>There is no need to leave the $ character from nested function calls.</li>
			<li>There are (hopefully) no problems with backslahes and double quotes anymore.</li>
			<li>The scripting functions $meta and $join are obsolete now.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Are there any special characters with specific functionality/limitations?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><code>[ ... ]</code> Displays contents of brackets only if at least one of fields referenced inside has been found.</li>
			<li><code>'</code> Outputs raw text without parsing. This will output the contained string and ignore all reserved characters (%,$,[,]) in it.</li>
			<li><code>$%[]</code>You have to put the single quote around these reserved characters if you want to use them unparsed.</li>
			<li><code>'</code>You have to put the single quote before this reserved character if you want to output a singe quote.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Examples for conversion</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><code>$num(&quot;%track%&quot;, 2)</code> is now <br /><code>$num(%track%,2)</code></li>
			<li><code>file://$replace(&quot;%_folderpath%&quot;,&quot;\&quot;,&quot;/&quot;)</code> is now<br /><code>file://$replace(%_folderpath%,\,/)</code></li>
			<li><code>%_tag_read% [%_tag%]</code> is now<br /><code>%_tag_read% '['%_tag%']'</code></li>					
		</ul>
