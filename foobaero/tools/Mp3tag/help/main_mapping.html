		<h2>User-defined field mappings</h2>
		<p>
		    Mp3tag displays tag fields either directly with their corresponding name from
		    the files (e.g., for files with APEv2 tags like Musepack or VorbisComments like
		    OGG and FLAC) or uses a <a href="main_tags.html">fixed mapping</a> from format-specific 
		    names to human-readable names (e.g., for ID3v2 identifiers or MP4 atoms). For example,
		    the ID3v2 field TPE1 is mapped to ARTIST in Mp3tag.
		</p>
		<p> 
		    You can customize mappings from Mp3tag's internal field name to
		    a user-defined field name in case you need to make field names
		    consistent across different types of tags (e.g., BAND in ID3v2 and 
		    ALBUM ARTIST in FLAC) via 'Options > Tags > Mapping'. There you can
		    create mappings for a specific tag type (APEv2, ID3v2, MP4, VorbisComment or WMA)
		    and provide a Source name (Mp3tag's name) and a Target name (your
		    preferred field name).<br />
		    After reading tags from files, Mp3tag translates all source field names
		    to their respective target (and vice-versa when writing tags).
		</p>
		<p>
		    Imagine you want to use one field name BAND for album artist regardless of
		    whether you are using MP3s (which already have BAND as Mp3tag's name for album artist)
		    or FLACs (which have ALBUM ARTIST or ALBUMARTIST or even another variant). To
		    create this unique field that can be used accross the different formats, you need
		    to create a new mapping for VorbisComment (since FLAC files have VorbisComments) and
		    provide ALBUM ARTIST as Source (it is the name displayed in Mp3tag so far) and BAND as
		    Target (this is the field name you like to use). When you now reload the files, you will
		    notice that instead of ALBUM ARTIST the field is now displayed as BAND and you can
		    use this in format strings and everywhere else without differentiating between
		    tag formats.
		</p>
		<p>
		    »But what happens when I save the tags?« you ask. Mp3tag then applies the mapping
		    in the reverse direction. So any field that uses the name provided as Target gets 
		    translated to the corresponding Source field name. It's also possible to map
		    multiple Source fields to one Target (e.g., ALBUM ARTIST and ALBUMARTIST to BAND).
		    Please note that this implies that all Source fields are written on tag updates.
		    Mapping one Source field to multiple Target fields is not supported.
