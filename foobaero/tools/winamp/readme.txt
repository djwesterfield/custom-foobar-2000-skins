This folder is for foobar2k's use with the shpeck component.  
The winamp.exe isn't really winamp -- it's just a blank file so that the shpeck config will
acknowledge the directory with winamp.exe in it as a valid winamp install folder.

I had to use winamp 5.51's milkdrop viz to get it to work with shpeck, but the 5.51's AVS didn't work,
so I used the AVS visualizations from winamp v 5.571.

Since this was a lot of trial&error on my part, I thought this package might be useful to other
foobar users who want some fancy visualizations.

Cheers!
