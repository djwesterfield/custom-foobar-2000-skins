How-to : Setup

If you prefer a video you can watch my setup on youtube : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlYqIfc_HBc

1. Install foobar2000 v 1.0.3 with defaults to default folder
2. Extract archive to install folder overwriting all files
3. Launch foobar
4. Choose columnsUI from the popup
5. Go to File-Preferences
6. Choose Display-ColumnsUI -> In the right pane where it says "FCL importing and exporting" click Import...
7. Browse to file "foobaero2010.fcl" and click import
8. Set your Media Library under Preferences
9. To make buttons work you have to go to Preferences-Tools-Run services click on import and import "run_services.xml"
10. To make visualization work go to Preferences-Visualisations-SHPECK
11. Point the "Winamp directory" to "Your foobar2000 installation folder"\tools\winamp and select "Advanced visualisation studio"
12. This release doesn't overwrite any of your previous settings. Any further customization of the components is pretty much up to you now.
